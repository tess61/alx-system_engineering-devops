Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from May 10, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC) to May 10, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC).
Impact: The web service "ExampleApp" experienced a complete downtime during the outage period. Users were unable to access the application, resulting in a 100% service outage for all users.

Timeline:

    10:00 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system sent out an alert for a sudden drop in server response time.
    10:05 AM: Engineers began investigating the issue, assuming it was related to a recent software deployment or a server misconfiguration.
    10:15 AM: Initial investigation focused on the application servers and the load balancer, looking for potential performance bottlenecks or network connectivity issues.
    10:30 AM: As no immediate issues were found, attention shifted to the database servers, suspecting a database connection problem or a query performance issue.
    10:45 AM: Database logs were analyzed, but no anomalies or errors were found, leading to confusion and a delay in identifying the root cause.
    11:00 AM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team, who joined the investigation.
    11:15 AM: After thorough analysis, it was discovered that the root cause of the outage was a misconfigured firewall rule blocking incoming traffic to the application servers.
    11:30 AM: The misconfigured firewall rule was corrected, and the application servers were able to receive incoming traffic again, resolving the issue and restoring normal service.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfigured firewall rule that blocked incoming traffic to the application servers. This misconfiguration was likely introduced during recent infrastructure changes.
Resolution: The misconfigured firewall rule was identified and corrected, allowing incoming traffic to reach the application servers again. Service was restored once the fix was applied.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Conduct a thorough review of recent infrastructure changes to identify any potential misconfigurations.
    Improve change management processes to include comprehensive testing and validation of infrastructure changes.
    Implement strict firewall rule review and validation procedures to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
    Enhance monitoring capabilities to include real-time checks for firewall rules and traffic flow, enabling quicker detection of similar issues.
    Establish incident response protocols to ensure swift escalation and involvement of the appropriate teams when critical issues arise.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

    Review and document the misconfigured firewall rule and update the firewall configuration accordingly.
    Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify areas for improvement in the change management process and infrastructure configuration validation.
    Enhance monitoring system to include firewall rule validation and alerts for any deviations or misconfigurations.
    Schedule regular audits of firewall rules to ensure compliance and prevent future misconfigurations.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar incidents in the future and ensure the reliability and availability of our web service.
